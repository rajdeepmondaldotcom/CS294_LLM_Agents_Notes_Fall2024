# Lecture 1

This [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QL-FS_Zcmyo) introduces the concept of **LLM Agents**, highlighting how large language models can act as adaptable “brains” for planning, tool use, and real-world interactions. A central theme is the importance of **step-by-step reasoning** (chain-of-thought) and related methods like **self-consistency** and **analogical reasoning**, which significantly enhance performance on complex tasks. The speaker also underscored critical **limitations**—such as susceptibility to irrelevant context, order sensitivity, and unreliable self-correction without an oracle. Overall, the lecture underscored that while LLM Agents are powerful and advancing rapidly, substantial **research** is still needed to address safety, multimodality, and robust long-horizon reasoning.

## Core Capabilities & Challenges

| **Topic**                            | **Notes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Key Challenges**<br>What are the main hurdles?           | 1. **Reasoning & Planning**: LLM Agents can still produce errors in complex tasks.<br>2. **Embodiment & Feedback**: Agents struggle with **long-horizon** tasks and continuous learning from environment feedback.<br>3. **Multimodal Understanding**: Need better **grounding** with diverse sensory inputs.<br>4. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Theory of mind and coordination can improve complex task performance. |
| **Safety & Privacy**<br>Why are they critical?             | - Agents may be vulnerable to **adversarial attacks**, produce **harmful** or **private** content.<br>- Ensuring **ethical** behavior, data **privacy**, and safe deployment is essential for real-world use.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Human-Agent Interaction**<br>What is the role of humans? | - Critical for **control**, **oversight**, and ensuring the agent’s outputs align with **human needs** and **values**.<br>- Designing effective prompts, dialogues, and **interaction modes** is key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Reasoning & Intermediate Steps

| **Topic**                                        | **Notes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)**<br>Why is step-by-step reasoning important? | - Humans naturally break down problems into smaller parts.<br>- **LLMs benefit** from intermediate reasoning steps (often called **“chain-of-thought”**) to handle complex tasks more accurately.<br>- Cited works (2017–2021) show that providing intermediate steps during **fine-tuning** or **prompting** greatly improves performance on math and reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K).                                                                                       |
| **Last-Letter Example**<br>How does it illustrate CoT?                 | - **Task**: Given a person’s first and last name, output the concatenation of their last letters.<br>- Traditional ML required many labeled examples and still had moderate accuracy.<br>- With LLMs, **one demonstration** plus **step-by-step reasoning** can yield **100% accuracy**.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Few-Shot vs. Zero-Shot**<br>What are the prompting differences?      | - **Few-Shot**: Provide examples with intermediate steps in the prompt. LLMs learn how to break down the problem by following the examples.<br>- **Zero-Shot**: No examples; can still sometimes trigger step-by-step reasoning with prompts like _“Let’s think step by step.”_<br>- Few-shot typically **outperforms** zero-shot, but new methods like **analogical reasoning** can generate relevant subproblems or examples on the fly, improving zero-shot performance. |
| **List-of-Sub-Tasks (Least to Most)**<br>What is it?                   | - Strategy: **Decompose** a complex task into simpler subtasks (inspired by Polya’s “How to Solve It”).<br>- Example: For a multi-step math word problem, solve smaller steps first (e.g., how many apples person A has, how many person B has) and then combine results.<br>- Greatly enhances **compositional** and **multi-step** reasoning accuracy.                                                                                                                    |
| **Self-Consistency**<br>Why sample multiple reasoning paths?           | - LLMs are generative models of next-token probabilities, not direct “answer” models.<br>- By generating multiple solutions (sampled reasoning paths) and then **voting** on the most common final answer, accuracy can substantially improve (a principle akin to **maximum marginal likelihood**).                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Analogical Reasoning**<br>How can it help?                           | - The model finds a **related problem** or example it has already seen (or can generate), then applies a similar reasoning pattern to the new problem.<br>- Outperforms naive “step-by-step” prompting in some benchmarks, because it automatically retrieves and adapts relevant examples.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Practical Limitations

| **Topic**                                              | **Notes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Context Distraction**<br>How do extra details affect LLM answers?          | - Irrelevant or misleading information can **confuse** LLMs.<br>- Even trivial additional sentences (e.g., “The sky is blue”) may degrade performance if appended to a math problem.                                                                                                                        |
| **Self-Correction**<br>Do LLMs reliably fix their mistakes?                  | - When prompted to “review” or “improve” answers, LLMs can correct mistakes **or** turn a correct solution into a wrong one.<br>- Self-correction often needs an **oracle** or **ground-truth** feedback (like **unit tests** for code) to confirm correctness.                                             |
| **Order Sensitivity**<br>Why does sequence of information matter?            | - Changing the **order** of statements (e.g., in a math problem) can cause accuracy to drop significantly.<br>- LLMs may process text in a **linear** fashion, struggling to “go back” and reevaluate facts out of order.                                                                                   |
| **Multi-Agent Debate**<br>Can multiple agents find truth through discussion? | - Multiple LLMs debating each other or providing feedback often reverts to the same principle of sampling many responses and picking the most common final answer (“self-consistency”).<br>- Without an external oracle, this approach alone does **not** guarantee more correctness than self-consistency. |
